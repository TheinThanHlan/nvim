## 1. Using NeoVim as an Python+Golang IDE

[Neovim](https://neovim.io/) is a pretty cool successor to Vim, focusing on compatibility while adding asynchronous plugin functionality and trying to clean up the code base. Having been fed up at various times with both Sublime Text (2 and 3) and Atom, and after realizing how much development I do over SSH, it seemed reasonable to check out using vim (or nvim, in this case) as my IDE. The advantages essentially boil down to:

- Consistent IDE over SSH or locally,
- No need to ever use the mouse while coding (takes longer to learn, but is faster; this is aided by vim-easymotion and Ctrl-Space),
- Itâ€™s been around forever, and frankly, probably always will be.

Complete instructions to Neovim as your IDE - Inspired by [Jarol Rodriguez's vim-python-ide](https://github.com/jarolrod/vim-python-ide).
